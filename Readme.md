## 📖 About This Project

**SmartSkin** is an AI-powered personalized skincare recommendation system designed to provide users with tailored product suggestions and skincare routines.  
It leverages **synthetic data generation**, **collaborative filtering**, **semantic search**, and **AI models** to recommend skincare products based on individual preferences, concerns, and skin profiles.

This project integrates an intuitive **web-based user interface** that allows users to interact with the system, explore personalized skincare routines, and receive intelligent suggestions.  
It is built with a combination of **machine learning**, **content-based filtering**, **collaborative filtering**, **Semantic search** , **cosine similarity** approaches to ensure accurate, diverse, and reliable recommendations.

## 🔬 How it works

### 🔹 **Data Collection / Synthetic Data** 
- Real and synthetic skincare datasets are used.
- Created artificial user-product interaction data to train models.  
- Simulated preferences based on **skin types (oily, dry, combination, sensitive)** and product categories.  
- Increased dataset diversity for better generalization.

### 🔹 **Collaborative Filtering**
- Implemented **User-User** and **Item-Item filtering**.  
- Provides recommendations by finding similar users or products.  
- Example: If User A and User B have similar concerns, products liked by User A are suggested to User B.

### 🔹 **Semantic Search**
- Uses **NLP embeddings** to understand product descriptions.  
- Finds products with similar ingredients or benefits.  
- Example: If user searches for *hydrating cream*, it can suggest *hyaluronic acid moisturizer*.

### 🔹 **User Dashboard**  
   - Displays routine suggestions, skincare products, and eco-friendly options.
